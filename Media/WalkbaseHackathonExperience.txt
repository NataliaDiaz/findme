The hackathon had a great atmosphere, even if it would have been nice to have more than 2 girls, out of 40 people.
Who would think  a concentration session of 48h on a weekend with 10h sleep in total? I saw a lot of motivation and enthusiasm. I have never eaten so much pizza in a row.
I have been in a couple of hackathons before, but I have never seen so much perseverance or sisu before. On sunday at 2pm everybody had something cool to show, either a good idea , a nice implementation, cool demo videos, or different games.
I got to get my hands dirty with Android development, which I never tried before, and I learnt a lot in only a weekend. During 2 days we kind of applied all that we learnt about software engineering, even if very often, we did not take care of having pretty code or following good practices. The main aim was to have something running by sunday. Our requirements and ways of implementing evolved very quickly, and I realized that, as often happens with software projects,  time is underestimated.
It was a demanding week-end in which we isolated ourselves from the rest of the world, but we were not along, and it was totally worth it. I also made new friends :)
